### Project Title
Android application analysis and comparision guide

### Project Overview

There are mobile applications everywhere. They are simple to make and may be profitable. Because of these two considerations, an increasing number of applications are being produced. In this project, we will thoroughly study the Android app industry by comparing over ten thousand apps from Google Play store in various categories. We'll seek for insights in the data to develop growth and retention plans, as well as provide a competitive analysis.

### Technologies Used
- programming language : Python
- libraries : Pandas, Plotly, sklearn, scipy, 
- algorithms : Regression, clustering and tree based classification and regression algorithms

### Repository Structure
- data : directory for datasets.
- docs : directory for project draft documentations and images used in the project.
- src  : directory for project code base.
- requirements.txt : file listing of all the python libraries used
