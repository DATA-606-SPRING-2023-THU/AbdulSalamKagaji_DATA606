# Draft Proposal 

This file is yourdraft proposal. 

The following are the Guidelines. 

For your project proposal, please use the following questions to guide your writing:

- What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?
- Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?
- What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?
- Where do you get the data to analyze and help answer your questions (creditability of source, quality of data, size of data, attributes of data. etc.)?
- What will be your unit of analysis (for example, patient, organization, or country)? Roughly how many units (observations) do you expect to analyze?
- What variables/measures do you plan to use in your analysis (variables should be tied to the questions in #3)?
- What kinds of techniques/models do you plan to use (for example, clustering, NLP, ARIMA, etc.)?
- How do you plan to develop/apply ML and how you evaluate/compare the performance of the models?
- What outcomes do you intend to achieve (better understanding of problems, tools to help solve problems, predictive analytics with practicle applications, etc)? 

## Project Title : Android application analysis and comparision guide
## Project Overview
There are mobile applications everywhere. They are simple to make and may be profitable. Because of these two considerations, an increasing number of applications are being produced. In this project, we will thoroughly study the Android app industry by comparing over ten thousand apps from Google Play store in various categories. We'll seek for insights in the data to develop growth and retention plans, as well as provide a competitive analysis.

## Objective
To provide current market demand for the application or idea of an application, esmiated reach and download forecast, competition comparision in the similar genere apps in the leading market.

Technologies Used
programming language : Python, react/streamlit (yet to decide on front-end framework)
libraries : Pandas, Plotly, sklearn, scipy, flask
algorithms : Regression, clustering and tree based classification and regression algorithms
network protocols : REST api's
